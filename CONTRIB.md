EmoReply is a chrome extension that parodies Gmail's SmartReply feature.  Gmail's SmartReply feature offers autoresponses that are cheery, happy, and overflowing with exclamation marks.  "Great!"  "Thanks!"  "Sure, I'll get back to you!"  At EmoReply, we replace the exclamation marks with tear marks, and give you autoresponses with angst.
